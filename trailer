Kdot academy
This final part will be simple. 
0. Blockchain
Blockchain - a distributed ledger. Just kidding. There is a ton of reading material on blockchains, so I will provide the following metaphor to share my thinking about them.
A bunch of kids want to build a lego castle. They each start with their own blank blueprint, and write the blueprint as they go.
How do these kids coordinate this effort?
Sure, they can assign a group leader. Unfortunately, these kids are quite unruly. Any single leader would abuse their power as the lego overlord.
The solution? These kids establish a unique democratic system. They take some time to tinker with their own foundations. Then they select one of the kids to propose their foundation as ~the~ foundation. Then they compare their foundation to the proposed foundation, and quickly decide which is better. If the proposed lego foundation is deemed, on average, better, it gets cemented and the blueprint is written. 
All the kids update their blueprint.
Who gets to propose the foundation? How is each foundation compared to the proposed foundation? What defines consensus? And why keep the blueprints separate?

1. Other terms
Trust economy - an ecosystem of buyers and sellers. Anyone can buy and anyone can sell. The currency is reputation.
On chain reputation - reputation that is stored on a blockchain. Like a credit score without gatekeepers
Decentralize - to empower people as opposed to institutions
Decentralized autonomous organization - a meritocratic (vs aristocratic) entity in whichpeople build stuff together
Decentralized science - open science with a focus on collaboration rather than competition and collusion
Token - a speculative currency that incentivizes holders to do stuff
Smart contracts - laws that execute automatically. Caveat: they are, by nature, exploitable.
Web3 - a catchy word describing blockchain tech products ('decentralized twitter'), controlled and owned by open communities rather than companies

Forward looking statement
It is with my pleasure to conclude my ... high variance writing journey. It goes without saying, but I am filled with gratitude. At the end of February, I am pumped to share more details about Kdot / Kdot Academy at Ethereum Denver.
