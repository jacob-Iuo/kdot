Kdot and Kdot academy
This final part will be simple. 

0. Blockchain
Blockchain - a distributed ledger. Just kidding. There is a ton of reading material on blockchains, so I will provide the following metaphor to share my thinking about them.
A bunch of kids want to build a lego castle. They each start with their own blank blueprint, and write the blueprint as they go.
How do these kids coordinate this effort?
Sure, they can assign a group leader. Unfortunately, these kids are quite unruly. Any single leader would abuse their power as the lego overlord.
The solution? These kids establish a unique democratic system. They take some time to tinker with their own foundations. Then they select one of the kids to propose their foundation as ~the~ foundation. Then they compare their foundation to the proposed foundation, and quickly decide which is better. If the proposed lego foundation is deemed, on average, better, it gets cemented and the blueprint is written. 
All the kids update their blueprint.
Who gets to propose the foundation? How is each foundation compared to the proposed foundation? What defines consensus? And why keep the blueprints separate?

1. Other terms
Trust economy - an ecosystem of buyers and sellers. Anyone can buy and anyone can sell. The currency is reputation.
On chain reputation - reputation that is stored on a blockchain. Like a credit score without gatekeepers
Decentralize - to empower people as opposed to institutions
Decentralized autonomous organization - a meritocratic (vs aristocratic) entity in which people build stuff together
Decentralized science - open science with a focus on collaboration rather than competition and collusion
Token - a speculative digital asset that may incentivize holders to do stuff
Smart contracts - laws that execute automatically. Caveat: they are, by nature, exploitable.
Web3 - a catchy word describing blockchain tech products ('decentralized twitter'), controlled and owned by open communities rather than companies

Some definitions may be misleading due to cognitive biases that the author may or may not possess at the time of writing. Efforts will be made to continuously refine these definitions until equilibrium is reached. 

2. Product
What is Kdot?
-Kdot is decentralized Reddit
-Kdot is new wiki - contributors are in the market for on chain reputation
-Kdot is a fugazi. It's a theoretical product. At the time of writing, it doesn't exist.
What is Kdot academy?
-Kdot academy is a group of people, currently representing a decentralized science movement
-Kdot academy is for educators and students, by educators and students
-Kdot academy is not a fugazi.
Why Kdot / Kdot academy?
-Science is broken in many ways. Kdot academy seeks to make science open again. Kdot seeks to establish the trust economy.

*The formation of Kdot is conditional on a thriving Kdot academy

4. Forward looking statement
It is with my pleasure to launch my writing journey. It goes without saying, but I am filled with gratitude. At the end of February, I am pumped to share more details about Kdot / Kdot Academy at Ethereum Denver.
