Intro
Experience on the picket line
On a cold rainy day in November, I ate a bagel. The next morning was sunny. I decided to share the same love that bagel experienced with the rest of the world.
I purchased four americanos and a few snacks. I trudged up bancroft, took aim, and fired conversation at the first friendly dog walking lady I came across. Rejection.
I proceeded to offer coffee to every soul in sight. The second soul, let's call her Roxanne. Roxanne graciously declined and together, we trudged onwards.
Rosanna taught me that frivolity can inspire great conversation. We chatted for 30 minutes and I learned about Berkeley's new Bakar space, as well as a program she ran to help graduate student careers. Rosanne learned about Kdot.
Next in line was the picket liners. I always hated picket lines. They reminded me of why I refused to engage with politics at UC Berkeley: unilateral thinking in the areas that mattered the most, such as "what if we are all just wrong?" This time was different because the kids running the pickets weren't traumatized kids. They were traumatized adults, although I believe the preferred term was graudate students.
I trudged up the hill to Stanley, took aim, and fired.
Space elevators, quantum algorithms, and a heated debate about war and politics later, I learned that I had hope. Hope for a movement that opposed tyranny. And so I trudged onwards.
Next in line was the IGI. I spoke with some more traumatized adults, but the conversations meandered. I ate a donut or something like that. It was delicious. And so my dad ended, and I found peace knowing that while there is hope in the world of progress, we still have a ton of work to do.

Stories on facism, pre-mobile world (italy/germany, cambodia, the cold war)
I am not qualified to comment here, other than saying fascism is bad and what happened in Cambodia was very very bad. 

Movies, media, and social media
I will now draw the reader's attention to a debate I've been having, internally, for some time now. If I am so concerned with gossip, misinformation, and radicalization aka institutionalized assholery: why am I so active so social media? Surely I am full of shit too, right?
The short answer is that while I am mad at the world for brainwashing my parents, myself, and my children - let's call them the eligmas - I am a hypocrite. I am part of the same old circus. I love movies. I love drama, and I absolutely adore reality TV because to me it is funny stupid. The fantasy that media presents me is an addiction I probably will never recover from. 
And I like getting people's attention.
Social media presents a different beast entirely. In many cases, it is just easier media consumption. Tik. Tok. But as time went on, and as social media became more participatory, it's obvious that the institutions that once controlled information flow have bested themselves yet again. Wall Street funded the companies that will eventually get people angry enough, enough for capitalism to face it's first real threat. Intellectual war.
