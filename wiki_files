Intro
Experience on the picket line
On a cold rainy day in November, I ate a bagel. The next morning was sunny. I decided to share the same love that bagel experienced with the rest of the world.
I purchased four americanos and a few snacks. I trudged up bancroft, took aim, and fired conversation at the first friendly dog walking lady I came across. Rejection.
I proceeded to offer coffee to every soul in sight. The second soul, let's call her Roxanne. Roxanne graciously declined and together, we trudged onwards.
Rosanna taught me that frivolity can inspire great conversation. We chatted for 30 minutes and I learned about Berkeley's new Bakar space, as well as a program she ran to help graduate student careers. Rosanne learned about Kdot.
Next in line was the picket liners. I always hated picket lines. They reminded me of why I refused to engage with politics at UC Berkeley: unilateral thinking in the areas that mattered the most, such as "what if we are all just wrong?" This time was different because the kids running the pickets weren't traumatized kids. They were traumatized adults, although I believe the preferred term was graudate students.
I trudged up the hill to Stanley, took aim, and fired.
Space elevators, quantum algorithms, and a heated debate about war and politics later, I learned that I had hope. Hope for a movement that opposed tyranny. And so I trudged onwards.
